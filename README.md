## üß† What I Learned

Through building this quiz application, I gained valuable experience in:

1. **React State Management**:
   - Handling dynamic states such as `currentQuestionIndex`, `answers`, and `score`.
   - Managing conditional rendering for different components like the Welcome Page, Quiz Page, and Result Page.

2. **React Component Architecture**:
   - Structuring reusable components (`ProgressBar`, `Question`, `ResultPage`, `WelcomePage`).
   - Prop drilling and passing down data dynamically between components.

3. **CSS with Tailwind**:
   - Using utility-first CSS classes for responsive and clean styling.
   - Managing positioning with Tailwind's `absolute`, `relative`, and `fixed` classes.
   - Styling interactive elements with hover and transition effects.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensuring components adapt to various screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive utilities (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`).
   - Using `vw` and `vh` units for dynamic positioning.

5. **Dynamic Progress Bar**:
   - Calculating and dynamically rendering the progress bar's width based on the `currentQuestionIndex`.

6. **Keyboard Event Handling**:
   - Adding navigation functionality using keyboard arrow keys.
   - Managing event listeners with `useEffect` and cleaning them up properly.

7. **Debugging and Testing**:
   - Using browser developer tools to debug positioning issues.
   - Logging state changes to ensure the correct flow of data.
